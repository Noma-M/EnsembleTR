# EnsembleTR

EnsembleTR is a tool for ensemble Tandem Repeat (TR) calling. It takes one or more VCF files with TR genotypes for a panel of samples and outputs a consensus set of genotypes.


# Installation

```
python3 setup.py install --user
```

Type `EnsembleTR`. You should see the help message appear.

# Usage

To run EnsembleTR, use the following command

```
EnsembleTR --out output.vcf
           --ref ref.fa
           --vcfs vcf1.vcf,vcf2.vcf,...
```

Both zipped and unzipped VCF files are accepted as input. EnsembleTR can currently process VCF files generated by [hipSTR](https://github.com/tfwillems/HipSTR)), [GangSTR](https://github.com/gymreklab/GangSTR), [adVNTR](https://advntr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#), and [ExpansionHunter](https://github.com/Illumina/ExpansionHunter).
